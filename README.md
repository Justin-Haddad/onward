ONWaRD is short for Online Network for Writing and Retrieving Data. This is a REST API service built with the Spring Boot framework that allows a platform where companies can electronically manage all their data, enabling them to go paperless. <br/>
This application demonstrates how to utilize Microsoft .NET Maui Framework, Spring Boot application, and Project Lombok to work together  to create an innovative product. <br/>

## _Installation_

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using this
   command: <br/> `git clone https://github.com/jack-turk-5/onward`
2. Import the project into your IDE (such as Eclipse or Visual Studio code).
3. start the application from OnwardApplication.java
4. Run the application as a Spring Boot application (usually located in your IDE), or use the Maven plugin `mvn spring-boot:run`.
5. Go to localhost:8080/ on your web browser.

*Try adding endpoints with simple text and stuff, 
follow the template for greeting and add endpoint methods to DemoController,
just make sure you do it in the form @GetMapping("/YOURTEXTHERE")
The first slash is important

## _Architecture_
Backend
* Spring Boot 3 & Java 17 LTS: The core of our backend services, providing REST API endpoints for data management and retrieval. It's configured for high availability and resilience, allowing for scalable microservices architecture.
* Maven: Used for dependency management and project build, Maven facilitates our continuous integration and deployment pipeline, ensuring consistent builds and version management.
* Project Lombok: Integrated to reduce boilerplate code, such as getters/setters, making the codebase more readable and easier to maintain.

Frontend
* Microsoft .NET MAUI Framework: Our choice for the frontend to create a responsive and interactive user interface that operates across different platforms (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) with a single codebase.
* C# and XAML: The primary languages used for development, where C# provides the logic and XAML defines the UI layout and design. This combination ensures a powerful yet flexible way to build our appâ€™s interface.

Development Environment
* Visual Studio Code: The main Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for the project, supported by various extensions to enhance productivity, such as: Extension Pack for Java, Spring Boot Extension Pack, .NET Extension Pack, and more for comprehensive development support.

Integration and Data Management
* JSON: Standard format for data exchange between the frontend and backend, ensuring compatibility and ease of data manipulation.
* API Endpoints: RESTful services designed for efficient data writing and retrieval, supporting various functionalities needed by the application.

## _Knowledge Gained_
We learned to combine Spring Boot, Microsoft .NET framework, and Project Lombok to create a product.
* Spring Boot 3 basic functionality and implementation.
* Understand the Basics implementation of the Microsoft.NET framework in building multi-platforms app  in the C# codebase.
* Converting data into and out of JSON into different formats.
* Follow Software Engineering principles.
* Implement the basic Project Lombok functions to boost productivity in development.
